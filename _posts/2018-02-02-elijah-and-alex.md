As far as I could remember, Alex hadn’t held Elijah since he was born. Since Alex was sitting in the living room looking kind of relaxed, I decided that I would hoodwink him into holding Elijah so that I could grab a photo of them together. I handed my niece, Allyson, my iphone hoping that she would “get the drift” when she saw what I did next, then walked over and set Elijah on Alex’s lap. Alex, of course freaked out a little but Allyson leaped into action and I was able to get my photo.
