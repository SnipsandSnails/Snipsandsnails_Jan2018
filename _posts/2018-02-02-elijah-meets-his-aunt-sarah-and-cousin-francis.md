<h2>Elijah Meets his Aunt Sarah and cousin Francis</h2>
My sister-in-law Sarah was at Central Michigan University's campus this morning, chilling. "I am at CMU and I have four hours to kill," she wrote on her Facebook page. "What should I do?"

I responded back, "Come see your new nephew."

So, I shared address information and Sarah stopped by our house to see Elijah.

Francis called while she was here. Francis had hurt her hand at the Cheer Clinic. Sarah headed back to CMU to pick up her daughter, but said that she would try to give Francis the chance to see Elijah.

Sure enough, about thirty minutes later they returned, and Francis was able to sit with Elijah for a few minutes.
