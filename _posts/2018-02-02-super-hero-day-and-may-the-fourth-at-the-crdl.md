Today we spent the afternoon at the Chippewa River District Library where it was “Super Hero” and “May the Fourth” day. All of the events at the library were focussed around the themes of super heroes or Star Wars. I took photos of Elijah and Kayla next to a Scout Trooper and Chewbacca the Wookie. Elijah didn’t quite know what to make of Chewbacca but didn’t get too weirded out when he had to be next to him.

While I worked a little on the computer, Kayla and Elijah played with the felt wall in the children’s section of the library. Elijah liked to unstick the felt pieces as quickly as Kayla put them up.

Elijah hadn’t seemed too eager to walk when we first arrived inside the library, but he seemed to get over this when he just suddenly started walking away from us. Kayla followed him, and when he tried to step up the lowest step on the staircase leading to the next level of the library Kayla stayed with him to climb all of the way up.
