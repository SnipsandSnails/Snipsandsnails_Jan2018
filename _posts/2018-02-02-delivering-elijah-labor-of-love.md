<h1>Labor and Delivery Grand Prix</h1>
<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Just Completed 12 laps on the labor and delivery grand prix. It’s amazing how quickly the decor loses its appeal after you walked by it a dozen times.

On the flip side, we were able to witness one of the nurses get hosed by a newborn in the nursery. One of the other nurses said that she had just commented that she wished he would pee when he suddenly let loose.

Josh only did that to me once I think during a diaper change when he was around a year old. You learn quickly to duck fast, change the diaper quickly or block that area of the body

<h1>Admitted into Labor and Delivery</h1>
<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Moved into a labor and delivery room. Now things are getting serious.

And there is a couch!

<h2>Comments</h2>
<b>Amy Bricker Efaw</b> If she can’t relax on the couch, you shouldn’t either lol!

<b>Jon Morgan</b> Well if that was true I’d have to wear the stylish hospital gown too, and nobody should have to see that.

<b>Amy Bricker Efaw</b> Everyone likes an eager participant!! Then you’ll get more of the full experience!

<b>Abigail Byrne Pryor</b> Yay!!

<b>Nancy Boyne</b> thanks

<b>Tamara Lawson</b> I think the shower is the best part!

<h1>Quite Shocking</h1>
<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Since the kids are getting a new brother, I wanted them to have a basic idea about how babies are born. I showed a video to josh which depicted childbirth in computer generated animation. He found the truth to be quite shocking.

<h1>Pitocin</h1>
<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Update: they’ve started Theresa on pitocin.

<h1>Let's have this baby by 3 p.m.</h1>
<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Update: the nurse and the doctor who is on call set the goal of having the baby by 3 pm.

Interestingly enough things are playing out very similar to Kayla’s birth. She was born around 3 pm and we spent the night before in the hospital.

But that was at sparrow, and they didn’t even have a couch in the delivery room.
