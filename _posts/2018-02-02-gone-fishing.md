<h1>Taking advantage of a Rainy Afternoon</h1>
Last Thursday after work I changed Elijah into pants and walked over to the Shepherd High School auditorium for the tailgating party that was being held before the start of the Shepherd High School football team’s first game of the season. We were there a little bit late, so people had already found their seats inside the stadium.

Elijah and I stopped by a table where you could win free prizes by spinning a wheel. Elijah’s eyes got really big when he saw me spin it, so after making sure it was okay I helped him spin it too.

After that, it was really hard to decide what Elijah and I should do. I hadn’t planned on staying for the game, so we couldn’t go into the stadium, and there wasn’t much else to do outside the gates. There was free food, but Elijah doesn’t eat hot dogs, and Theresa was bringing home pizza for dinner.

On our way by the stadium, Elijah spotted some stones which had been laid out around a drain. As he checked them out, I showed him how to lightly throw the stones into the water and make a splash. Elijah was all over that, and while I watched tried throwing a few stones into the water.

After we were home, Elijah took an interest in the mud puddle in front of the porch which was left over from the rain. He asked for his fishing pole. We found the pole and some rings. He began throwing the rings and then “fishing” them out of the muddy water. We continued to work on this until Theresa returned home with pizza.
