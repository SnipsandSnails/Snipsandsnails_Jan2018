Saturday night I was holding Elijah and just trying different ways of keeping him amused, when he suddenly made a couple of baby talk-type sounds. I responded by copying his sound, and then he copied me.

We spend so much time as parents responding to Elijah’s cries that it is really exciting to see even the briefest form of communication. It’s like a hint of things to come.

When Kayla was less than a year old, a moment like this happened when I stuck my tongue out at her, and she stuck her tongue back at me.
