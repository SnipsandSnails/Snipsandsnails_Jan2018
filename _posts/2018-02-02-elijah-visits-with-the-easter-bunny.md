Today after Church we stopped by Wal-Mart so that Elijah could have his picture taken with the Easter Bunny in the Garden Center. As I moved bags of empty cans and bottles out of my trunk and into a cart, I realized that we were actually going to need another cart just for Elijah to ride in. So, the kids helped me push the two carts into the store.

We met up with Theresa in the CMU Store at the front of Walmart, then walked with her to the back of the store so that she could clock out.

There wasnâ€™t a line at all so we were able to see the Easter Bunny right away. Kayla and Josh sat down on the bench next to the Easter Bunny while he held Elijah.
