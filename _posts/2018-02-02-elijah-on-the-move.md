<h1>Elijah on the Move</h1>

The key word these last couple of months has been “mobility,” as you have been learning more and more about the ways in which you can get from point A to point B on your own. First, in November you discovered that if you had a little bit of support from someone, you could walk up and down the hallway by moving your legs. This turned into a fun game of chase where your older sister would shout “I’m going to get you” and you would run giggling and screaming down the hallway.

But, I think that for you all of the fun was in moving back and forth, not so much keeping away from the person chasing you. We also taught you how to turn the tables, so as soon as you had gotten away from us you would turn around and chase us. It reminds me of the seen in “Star Wars” when Han Solo chases the small squad of stormtroopers down the corridors, until they meet up with a whole legion of troopers and then the tables are turned.

Then earlier this week you crawled for the first time. This is something that you’ve been working on for a while, but this was the first moment that I’ve seen where your legs and hands moved in concert and everything seemed to click. You crawled to get a tube of diaper cream, which I think is funny because that is what motivated your sister to crawl when she was about your age (we have the video to prove it). After that, it was almost like you couldn’t <i>stop</i> crawling.

Tonight I was getting your stuff together and asked your brother to keep an eye on you. When I left you, you were at the edge of the living room close to the hallway. When I stepped back out of my bedroom, you had turned the corner into the hallway and were heading in my direction. Josh looked up, and said that all he saw was the heels of your feet as you crawled out of his view. I think that this is where we will need to change our strategy and be a lot more vigilant about watching you. No longer can we expect you to stay within a small area within the living room.

Your teeth are another new development. You’ve gotten four new ones, and already you’ve been using them to tear into food and you’ve chomped down on my finger once or twice. It is hard to look past your new teeth when you smile.

We are going to be putting up the Christmas tree tomorrow. I hope that down the road as you get older you will be a bigger participant in the decorating of the tree, but for now you will be a spectator.

There were some interesting events in our area today that I hope to take you to in the future. The Dicken’s Christmas was in Mt. Pleasant, and the local library held its Polar Express event. These are both things that I think that you will enjoy when you are a couple of years older.

Tonight I took pictures of your hand next to mine, just to show how small yours is by comparison. I guess I took the photo to show the contrast in size, but in the back of my mind it was because I know too well that you won’t be small forever.

I love you.
