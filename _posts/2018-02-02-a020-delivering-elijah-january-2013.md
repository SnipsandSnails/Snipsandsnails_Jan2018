The last eight months have just flown by. In that time, we’ve shared the good news that you were coming with the kids, then our friends and relatives, shared the news that you’re a boy, then last month we attended a baby shower thrown by your Aunt Susan, and in January there was another shower held here in our hometown for your mom’s friends. Your mom has also been working hard to get your nursery, a.k.a. that space in our room we once referred to as our closet, ready for your arrival. Last week was your mom’s last monthly checkup, and from now until you’re born she is going to be seeing the doctor weekly.

Now that all of the big stuff is out of the way, the only thing that we need to happen is for you to emerge into the world.

I’ve tried to think of something profound to stay about these next few weeks. Mostly what I’m thinking about is how I don’t think I’ll ever feel “ready,” no matter how much we prepare. We can be ready with the basics—we have diapers, clothes, toys, and the pack-n-play is already en route–but really I’m talking about the question that goes through my mind, “Am I ready to do this all over again?”

Last Spring, I felt confident that not only would I be able to do it again, but that I would be able to do things better. There is no perfect science behind being a good parent, but I’m hoping that my experience with our first two (which have survived to the ages of 10 and 12, so we must have done something right) will give me a new perspective that will guide my approach with you. Instead of dreading the next bottle feeding, or the diaper change, I will be trying to enjoy the moment for what it is–time I’m spending with you while you are a baby. Two years of babyhood sounds like a long time, but I know now that it really isn’t. You’ll be born, then two years old, and then you’ll be six and starting school like your siblings did, and life will speed up after that. I know by now that I can’t slow down your progress, but I won’t try to hurry you along, either.

<h1>Celebrity Baby Voice Overs</h1>
Inspired by the classic movie “Look Who’s Talking,” tonight I asked my kids which celebrities we should hire to voice their little brother’s thoughts after he is born. “Like Bruce Willis from ‘Look Who’s Talking.’” My daughter, Kayla, asked, “Who is Bruce Willis?”

I continued to make some suggestions of who could do the voice-over for our baby and examples of what they might sound like:
<h2>David Duchovny</h2>
(Recalling what it was like to be born)

I was sitting in the womb, just relaxing and minding my own business, when suddenly the walls began to shake and I became very disoriented. Before I knew it, a bright light opened up below my head and I was suddenly being pulled into some other place..some other dimension.

My first thought was that the I was being abducted by aliens! But then my suspicions of the government’s complacency in an alien coverup were confirmed when I arrived inside a room filled with men and women in lab coats!

I was thrusted onto the chest of an overly emotional woman–who, I learned later was my mom–then after a few minutes I was carried over by one of the government officials to a dissection table, where I was placed under a bright light. I was then poked and prodded nearly beyond my tolerance. I cried, but this did not deter them.
<h2>Peter Cullen (a.k.a. the voice of Optimus Prime)</h2>
(Later, while at home)

Morgans, change my diaper . . . and…roll out!
<h2>James Earl Jones</h2>
I want my bottle!
<h2>Regis Philbin</h2>
So, you’re going with answer “D, prepare another bottle,” eh? Is that your FINAL answer?
<h2>William Shatner</h2>
I’ve..dropped my . . .binky!
<h2>Crew of the Satellite of Love</h2>
Tom Servo: Oh great. Of course there has to be a crowd here when I’m naked and covered with goop.

Crow: Hey, is this how you came out of the womb, Joel?

Joel: Which part? The crying or the kicking?

Crow: So, which one’s the daddy and the mommy? There are so many people here, and its hard to tell them apart.

Joel: I’d say the mommy is the weepy lady who is laying down on the bed wearing the hospital gown.

Crow: That’s a relief. I was wondering why she was still in her pajamas this late in the day.

Tom Servo: Whoa..lots of twists and turns. Feels good to be in her arms, though.

Crow: Which one is the daddy? The one at the end?

Joel: No, he’s the doctor.

Crow: Whoo-hoo daddy is a doctor?

Tom Servo: You wish. My guess is that its the shutterbug to the right. Hey bozo, this isn’t a good time for photos!

Crow: I hope he gets my best side.

Joel: Ow, hey..what are they doing to my umbilical cord?

Crow: I don’t know, but they better hope that is my umbilical cord!

Tom Servo: They’re giving scissors to the bozo with the camera. I hope that doesn’t mean what I think it means…

Joel: Oh, ouch..

Crow: Noooo!

Joel: Calm down Crow, he only cut the umbilical. We’re fine.

Crow: I’m going to miss the endless supply of tea and hamburgers.

Tom Servo: Now we’re being moved to an examination table. Oh, hello.

Joel: This day couldn’t possibly get any worse.

Crow: Um, Joel, it just did…that nurse said something about a circumcision.

Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo: Nooooo!!

<h1>Pregnancy Update</h1>
<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Theresa has another doctor’s appointment tomorrow, where we will get a better idea of when the baby might arrive. Right now, it could still be any time between now and the first week of February.

Plans for his baptism are already in the works. It will be in March at the Mount Pleasant Community Church. I will be following up with more details later.
<h3></h3>
<h1>Waiting for Baby</h1>
Theresa Morgan and I are on pins and needles waiting for the baby to arrive. We’re more than a week away from the due date, but whenever Theresa reports a new ache or ailment, I wonder if it is a “sign” that she will go into labor.

I think a lot about how much life will change after the baby, yet still need to stay somewhat the same. When Kayla Morgan was born, we set our schedules around her feedings and naps. With Josh, we continued the schedule that we started with Kayla without too much interruption to our lives. But, it was easier to stay in step with our kids when they were a baby and a toddler.

Now that Kayla is 12 and Josh is 10, they require a schedule that is more flexible and busier. We’ve also branched out a great deal more since they were babies and made friends, gotten involved with community projects, and found a home church. I’m sure that we will slow down as we adjust to the new baby, but I think he will benefit the most if we stay as close to our regular routine as possible. Kayla and Josh certainly would, too.

The first time we attend church after he is born will be a test of how well we can stick to our “normal” routine. Theresa and I weren’t regular church goers when we first got married, so we didn’t look for a home church in Lansing, and once we had Kayla it seemed to daunting to try. With Shepherd being smaller, it seemed right to start looking into the churches. But, after Josh was born it was a question of whether I wanted to get a toddler and a baby ready for church on my own each Sunday morning.

My thinking shifted when we started going, and now it is a much bigger priority. With Josh and Kayla being older now, I hope that I am up to the challenge of getting all four of us ready for church. If I am, and can keep it up on a regular basis, then other events should be a breeze.

<h1>2 men simulate labor pain on TV Show</h1>
This is a must watch video for every man … and woman … on the planet. Two Dutch men who host a television show can now say they have some insight into the pain of childbirth.

<h2>Monkey Watch Update</h2>
<b>Theresa Morgan</b>

Monkey Watch Update: Went to my appointment this morning, and the little guy has dropped considerably since last week. I am now 1 1/2 cm dilated and his head his nice and low. So, it’s just a matter of time and contractions now. Also found out the hospital is limiting visitors due to the flu, so Kayla and Josh won’t be allowed in to see their brother. In fact no one under the age of 18 admitted, AND the only other visitors allowed are spouse and well grandparents. So, I guess that means we’ll be seeing a lot of you visiting the house when we get home. No worries, lots of photos, etc will be making their way to facebook I’m sure.
