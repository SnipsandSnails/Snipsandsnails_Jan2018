I’m not sure why “Six Months” seems so old. Maybe its because it seems like only yesterday I was telling people that Elijah was “2 weeks” or “3 months” old, and now when I say “6 Months” it sounds like I should be saying “half a year,” which seems so much closer to a year.

In these last six months, Elijah has grown from a little newborn who was light to hold and cuddled against my shoulder to a little to this little six month old person who can look me in the eye when he stands on my lap.

He loves sitting in his jumper, and the jumper at the daycare, and at my in-laws he seemed to like the swing that my mother-in-law had picked up for him. He has developed an attraction to our cell phone, so much so that we’ve started to send toys with him to the daycare so that he isn’t always grabbing the daycare owner’s iPhone. He is also curious about computer keyboards, and likes to try to pound on the buttons.

The kids and I are always doing something silly to get a reaction from him. I love to see him smile, and his laugh is so unique that it’s infectious. During this past week, while he was sitting on my lap Elijah was trying to blow raspberries.

He has begun to join us for meals regularly from his high chair, as opposed to staying in his swing or sitting on our laps, and even at restaurants we’ve been trying him in high chairs. It will be a relief when he is able to ride at the front of shopping carts, because his car seat always takes up a lot of room. And, he certainly would be happier if he was able to look around while we were shopping instead of being strapped down the whole time.

In the last few months, Elijah has learned how to roll over on his own, stay seated with help, grip things, and has even been trying solid foods. When I see him now, I see the rising potential for him to learn so many new things and go in so many new directions that I can only guess what is next. He’s been working his legs and doesn’t stay on his back for more than five minutes, so I’m guessing that he will be crawling pretty soon.
