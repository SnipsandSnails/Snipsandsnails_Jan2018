<h2>Riding in the front of the Cart at Wal-Mart</h2>
Although we prefer that Elijah rides in the front of the cart with his special cushion, I had left home without it so Theresa had to improvise a little while she was shopping. He was a little wobbly, but did really well in the seat. He only tried to suck on the metal bars once. In the future, though, I’m going to make it a point to bring the special insert.

When we left the house, I wasn’t sure if Elijah was going to be awake or not when we arrived at Wal-Mart. If he had been sleeping, we would have brought him in with the car seat. But, when I saw that he was awake, I suddenly had the option of carrying him in “freestyle.” I wanted to try this because while risky I felt like it gave him more of a chance to look around and interact with people. Plus, I wasn’t planning on spending a lot of time in Walmart.

<h2>Ready for School</h2>
On our way out of the Shepherd Elementary School on Thursday, I decided that I wanted to get a group shot of the kids. I positioned them on the raised garden in front the elementary school. The kids weren’t very happy about having their photos taken, but I felt like this was an important moment for all three of them. With Elijah being only six months old, this could easily be the first in a series of photos, which means that we may be visiting this same spot in the near future.

<h2>Hanging out in Kayla’s Room</h2>
Not sure what it is about seeing Elijah sitting on Kayla’s American Girl-sized furniture, but I think its really cool that he fits. This is follow up to our attempts a couple of months ago to take photos of him on a doll-sized bench, scooter, horse, and of course the chair you see in the photo here. Back then, though, he didn’t have enough muscle support to sit up on his own. Now things are getting interesting . . .

<h2>Visiting the Shepherd Park</h2>
These photos were taken a couple of weeks ago while we were at the Shepherd Park with Josh, my friend Louie, and Louie’s sons. Elijah is still at an age where the playground equipment is too advance for him, but it was fun fitting him in the infant seat.

<h2>Sleeping</h2>
One of the best moments in the afternoon is when Elijah finally falls asleep. He looks so peaceful.

<h2>Brothers</h2>
I hope that Elijah and Josh will become steadfast friends in the future. They already look really natural together whenever Josh holds him. My favorite type of shot is of the two of them sitting on the couch, looking like they’re watching TV.

<h2>Me and My Pal</h2>
We had just gotten back from the Dollar General, and after carrying Elijah into the store for some reason I took him out of his car seat instead of detaching it and carrying them both to the house. While I had him in my arms, I sat back down in the driver’s seat of my car and just hung out a little.

<h2>Visit to Island Park</h2>
Earlier in August, I took the kids to Island Park where Elijah swung in his first infant swing. Later, the kids wanted to splash around in the Chippewa River so I let Elijah spend a little bit of time sitting on the grass. He was fascinated with my shoelaces.

<h2>How does he do that?</h2>
One of Elijah’s favorite things to suck on is his toes. On his foot. How he manages to bend his leg up far enough to reach his toes with his mouth, I probably won’t understand. He just does it. His older brother tried to do the same, but couldn’t. I know I wouldn’t be able to.

<h2>Happy Seven Months</h2>
This picture was taken right after Elijah turned 7 months old. During the last month, he has continued to try new foods, can babble and shriek like crazy, and has mastered the skill of skootching backwards across the floor. He is still merely a little guy, but has a lot more heft to him when I carry him and continues to demonstrate a unique personality. Fortunately, he is a relatively happy baby who loves his family very much. We feel the same about him.
