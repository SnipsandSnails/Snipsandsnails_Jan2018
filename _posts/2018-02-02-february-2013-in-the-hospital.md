<b>Darth Lou Holliday </b>So, does he look like Josh or Kayla?

<b>Jon Morgan</b> He has curly hair like Kayla did. Theresa says that he has her nose.

<b>Nancy Boyne</b> Josh and a little Kayla but most of all he look like Eljah

<h1>Circumcision</h1>
<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Update: Elijah will be seen by the doctor for his circumcision soon.

<b>Crystal Watanabe</b> Hope that goes well!!! My ped was out, so his fellow associate did it and she didn't put enough vasoline, which left me pulling crusted gauze off my poor screaming son's peepee. Talk about traumatizing...

&nbsp;
<h1>Picture Time</h1>

<b>Jon Morgan</b>

Update: Elijah has passed a checkup by Dr. Walvisch, been screened, and had his picture taken by one of the hospital volunteers (in his lumberjack themed onsie). He still needs to be circumcised, and then kept for a little while after for observation. Then hopefully he and Theresa can be discharged.

Overall, Theresa and Elijah are doing well.

Kayla Morgan and Josh Alan Morgan are patiently waiting to meet their little brother. — with Theresa Morgan at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/McLarenCentralMichigan">McLaren Central Michigan</a>.

<b>Jon Morgan</b> Although we got the hearing results back, and the sheet said that he needed his ears test again. We asked the nurse about it, and she said she checked that box off by mistake, that he passed fine. That "oops" makes a big difference.

<b>Darth Lou Holliday</b> Hi this is Kayla Morgan. Kayla Morgan says hi. HI.

<b>Jon Morgan</b> Hey

&nbsp;
