<b>A Saturday with just Elijah</b>

This weekend our oldest two kids, Kayla and Josh, are in Marlette visiting with their cousins and grandparents. Today is the first time that I can remember where I've spent the day entirely alone with their little brother, Elijah.

There have been lots of days where Josh or Kayla were at a friends' house, gone out with their mother, or stayed somewhere over night, but not both at the same time. The closest I've come is probably when they were at school and Elijah was at home, but then I would see them in the morning and again in the afternoon after they returned home from school.

The time with Elijah has reminded me of what i was like back when Kayla was a baby. Even though I have Elijah to take care of, I can't help but feel a little lonely and isolated. And, at four months old he is not much of a conversationalist.

I really appreciate Josh's and Kayla's help with their little brother over the last few months. They've really stepped up. Most of all, I miss having them around to talk to. Even Josh's stories about how many houses he has built or creepers he's killed in Minecraft would be great to listen to right now.
