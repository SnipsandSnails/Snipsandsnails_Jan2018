Dear Elijah,

Today, you turned five. I’ve been thinking a lot about how cool the number five can be. For example, there was a show I liked to watch called “Babylon 5.” The robot in “Short Circuit” was named “Johnny Five.” We have five fingers, and five toes.

There are a lot of series of movies where the fifth movie was the best one. Such as “Star Wars,” for which “The Empire Strikes Back” is considered to be the best movie. The fifth “Harry Potter” movie was probably pretty good, although I can’t remember which one that is.

But, at five years old you are way more extraordinary than any robot, television show, or movie. Just in the last few months you’ve learned so much. You started preschool in September, have started to learn a little about how to read, can add, and have mastered your colors and your shapes. You are always curious about the world around you, asking one question on top of the other.

We celebrated tonight first with you opening up your presents, and then you blew out the candles on your cake. But, then you decided that you didn’t want to have any cake. Instead, you’ll probably have some tomorrow when we spend our day together. Not just any Friday, but what I’ve called an “Eliday.” I took the day off from work so that we can actually do something together, sort of in honor of your birthday but mostly just because.

It is hard to believe that someone small could have such a huge impact on all of our lives. And, of course, you’re not so small any more. Perhaps that’s also what five is all about.

Love,

Daddy
