<h3>Visit with the Easter Bunny</h3>
<h3>Saturday</h3>
We drove over to Marlette on Saturday after Theresa ended her shift at Walmart. This weekend marked a lot of firsts for Elijah: His first trip to his Grandma and Grandpa’s house, his first long car ride, but most of all his very first Easter.

We arrived at my in-laws around seven o’clock and unloaded the car. Just a few hours later, my sister-in-law Sarah and her kids, Francis and Zachary, pulled in. The kids talked a little and hung out until it was bedtime.
<h3>Sunday</h3>
Everyone went to church on Sunday for the Easter worship service. It was a little bit of a challenge keeping a 2-month-old satisfied during a church service, but Elijah pretty much behaved himself. Even his Aunt Susan helped out by holding him for a little bit.

After church, Kayla and Josh walked over to Susan’s house with their cousins. Theresa and I took advantage of our time with Elijah by taking some pictures of him in his “My First Easter” outfit.

We drove over to Susan’s house for an Easter dinner. The food was great, and we managed to get all of the cousins together for a group photo. There was also an egg scramble which looked like fun.
