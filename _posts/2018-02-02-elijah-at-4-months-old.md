The Saturday when you turned four months old was pretty typical. When you woke up, I changed you and started to feed you your morning bottle. The house stayed pretty quiet because your older brother, Josh, had spent the night at Noah’s house. Kayla and Athena, who had spent the night here, slept in late (first rule of the sleepover: nobody sleeps, then you must sleep in as long as possible).

As the girls started to wake up and look for breakfast, I asked them if they would be interested in going on a walk around the trail. Soon, Kayla’s other friends Hannah and Kiki were involved. We stopped at the Hollidays’ house and our group grew exponentially.

We traveled light during our walk around the trail. I had your diaper bag. Kayla wanted to go back to the house to get a water bottle, but I told her that we were already on our way and that she would need to make due. Kiki brought a whole box of Cheez-its that she shared with the rest of the kids.

One advantage of having a large group is that you have many helpful hands. I don’t think I pushed you more than a few minutes thanks to Kayla and her three friends, who were obsessed with pushing your stroller, and Louie. We stopped at the elementary school playground where I fed you while the older kids played on the equipment. I grabbed Kayla and asked her to sit with you on a slide so I could get a photo. Kiki also “borrowed” you and took you on your first trip down a playground slide. I can’t say if you liked it or not, but judging from your expression you weren’t sure what to make of the experience.

After you had drank most of your bottle, we gathered up all of the kids and headed towards home. We stopped at the convenience store on Wright Ave. that looks like a log cabin. Louie and I bought something to drink, and the girls refilled a water bottle which they had been sharing a little bit.

Our walk home was uneventful. Once your mom was home, Josh and I left with Louie and his three kids to go garage saling down around Alma and St. Louis. We ended up in St. Louis where we stopped at a miniature replica of the Mackinac Bridge. Louie pretended to throw Josh over the edge.

That night, your mom and I took pictures of you in your “4 Months” sticker tie. Every time we get out the stickers and take photos of you to celebrate another month gone by, I wonder where the time has gone. It’s only been four months since you were born, but yesterday I was thinking about how much you’ve grown in both weight and height. You once were so limited on what you could do, but now you are looking around, babbling in your baby talk language, and interacting with people and your environment. I don’t think it will be very long at long before you can sit up on your own.

You are typically a happy little baby boy, always ready to smile or laugh. The only exception to this is when you aren’t getting what you want, and then you speak your mind by fussing or crying. The funniest thing we’ve seen you do is talk back to the little bird design on you bottle when I pretended to make it talk to you. This afternoon, when you were fussing while I was putting you down for a nap I tried to cheer you up by making the frogs on your spit rag sing to you. You cracked me up so much when you started to talk back to them, that I almost forgot that it was supposed to be naptime.
