It’s safe to say that the third month of your life was the busiest of all, except maybe February when you were born. Over the last few weeks, you’ve started to demonstrate a personality of your own. You are talking more and you are taking interest in the world around you.

You’ve made a lot of new friends, most of whom you probably aren’t aware of yet. You are the center of attention at the daycare where you stay when your mom and I are both at work, and your older siblings are at school. You’ve met a dozen of Kayla’s friends, and a few of Josh’s friends.

April started out bitterly cold but ended with some nice, warmer days. This was a sign that you will hopefully be spending more time outside, and perhaps in less layers. Speaking of clothing, your mom shed a couple of tears towards the end of April when she separated out the clothes that no longer fit you and moved them down to the basement.

I remember when you were barely longer than my forearm, but now your head almost touches the bottom of my chin when I sit you up on my lap.

I can’t understand you when you talk, but I still love listening to you. I’ve made several recordings of you talking either to a picture of Percy or the TV. You also like to listen to me, and you like to make me laugh. Your mom and I have picked up the trick of pretending to be sad or cry, this always draws out a wide smile from you.

You were at the skating arena in mid-April when your sister competed in the skating competition. You also attended your very first Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival. You slept while we visited the garage sales, but you were able to visit with the animals at the petting zoo, talk to Kayla’s monkey balloon while we were waiting for your brother and sister to finish up at the Children’s Village, watched your very first parade (you were scared by the announcer), and you even joined us for the pancakes dinner, but instead of pancakes and sausages you had your usual bottle of formula.
