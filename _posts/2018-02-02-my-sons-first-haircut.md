This afternoon, we took our sixteen-month-old son Elijah to the hair salon in Walmart to get his very first haircut. Although we loved the way that his hair curled up and added to his overall cuteness, it was getting pretty long.

Our neighbor’s daughter, Melissa Holliday works at the salon in Walmart. We had made arrangements to bring Elijah in on a day when she worked because we knew her and, for the most part, Elijah knows her also. I don’t know if this helped with the process of sitting still and having his haircut, but he stayed remarkably calm throughout.

Elijah sat on Theresa’s lap. Melissa covered Theresa, then gave Elijah a hair bib of his own.
