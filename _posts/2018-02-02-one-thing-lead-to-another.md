Last night Elijah was playing with the pieces from Josh’s Pokemon Battle Colosseum. I could see the different pieces from that set sitting around on the floor and in the toy bins, so I decided that I would put some of it together so that Elijah would get the full effect.

When you put the whole thing together, you end up with three levels. The lowest level includes a lake, a small river, and some rocky outcroppings. On the second level, there is this round wooden (because it’s painted brown) platform which also happens to be a trap door, and at the highest level you have some more rockiness and a place where you can insert a volcano. So, I suppose you could call it an island.

I showed Elijah how the trapdoor worked by setting an action figure on top of it and hitting the release button. He got such a kick out of it that I tried again. Soon, we were taking turns dropping different characters down the hole, and Elijah was laughing so hard I was almost afraid he would fall over. He liked watching Homer Simpson drop through the trapdoor the most, because before it happened I’d make him say something like, “Mmm, Chocolate,” and then as he dropped shout “Du’oh!” After that, while he was drinking his bedtime bottle Elijah continued to repeat Homer-isms.

This morning, I found a compilation video of Homer saying “Du’oh” over and over again, and Elijah got a kick out of that.
